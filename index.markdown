# Release Engineering for Machine Learning

CS4295

Teachers: [Sebastian Proksch], [Luís Cruz]

The world of Software Engineering has been revolutionized in the last decade. Instead of releasing software updates yearly, companies can now release multiple times per week, sometimes even per day, to their customers. This allows much quicker reactions to market demands, software failures, and is crucial to increase the business value of software. These improvements have been mostly enabled by advances in release engineering and, in this course, we will learn about the techniques and technologies that build the foundation for modern release engineering.

We will go on a journey that starts at continuous integration and then moves on to continuous delivery, continuous deployment, and continuous experimentation. We will discuss the theory and the current research on various related subjects like containerization, testing, or monitoring and will put the learned theory into practice. As a running example, we will build a pipeline for a machine learning application, which -compared to traditional release engineering- poses additional challenges, like data versioning or model deployment.
