# Release Engineering for Machine Learning


In this course, we will go on a journey that starts at continuous integration and then moves on to continuous delivery, continuous deployment, and continuous experimentation. We will discuss the theory and the current research on various related subjects like containerization, testing, or monitoring and will put the learned theory into practice. As a running example, we will build a pipeline for a machine learning application, which -compared to traditional release engineering- poses additional challenges, like data versioning or model deployment.

## Learning Objectives

After following this course, you will be able to:

- Apply standard techniques of release engineering;
- Apply version control techniques to machine learning artifacts, like data or models Design a deployment pipeline for a machine learning application;
- Implement quality control techniques in a machine learning pipeline;
- Analyze and improve existing deployment pipelines;
- Evaluate and document design decisions in deployment pipelines.
