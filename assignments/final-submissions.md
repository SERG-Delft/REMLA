To finish the course, you need to upload the final state of all your devliverables.
Please prepare a .zip file that has the following content:

Create a base folder `team-<your number>` and place all the following files into this base folder:

- Checkout all your repositories and delete the respective `.git` subfolders.
- Add the report, make sure to include both the sources *and* a .pdf file.
- Add the instruction file that you have used in the assignments to link to all external resources.
We do not expect that you will keep all repositories maintained forever, but make sure that everything is still accessible for the next months, so we can finalize the grading.

On Brightspace, you will find an assignment *Final Submission* that allows you to upload your .zip file.
The deadline for uploading your submission is June 29, 11:59pm.
Please note that the upload can take some time, so plan accordingly and do not postpone the upload to the very last minute.

You can upload your submission as often as you like, only the last version will be kept.
We strongly recommend that you make use of that to register your intermediate submissions, so you can ensure that you won't miss the final deadline.
