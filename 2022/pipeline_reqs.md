# ML pipeline improvements

As part of your final project you need to pick up the [baseline project] and improve it based on the topics you learned in the classes.
Hence, by the end of week 5 (May 16â€“20) you should already have most of these tasks set up:

- Convert notebook into a Python project. Proper file structure.
- Pipeline automation.
<!-- - DVC -->
- Version control.
<!-- - Git + DVC -->
- Unit tests. (at least 1)
- Static analysis tools.
<!-- - pylint, dsslinter, mllint -->
- Github Actions.
- Orchestration of the application.
- Monitoring application metrics.
- Data validation.

After implementing the requirements above you should start working on the extension you proposed. Note that this is a soft deadline, agree with your coach what is the best deadline for your group.
