{: .caution}
Please note that the exam day has changed to Friday, June 30!

The study load of the course varies throughout the weeks.
We will start with several *lectures* that provide you with the required background knowledge.
In the second half, the course will transition towards group assignments and we will only meet in the large group for reviewing and discussing the peer feedback that you gave each other.

In the following, you will find the schedule for the *lectures* and the relevant assignments/peer reviews.
Make sure that you keep an eye on all relevant dates and deadlines.

### Lectures and Q&A Sessions

Please check your [timetable](https://mytimetable.tudelft.nl/schedule) for all in-person meetings.
The Q&A sessions are meetings in the classroom.
We will reflect on common issues, recurring comments that we have seen in the weekly peer feedback, and will be available for clarifications around the team project.
