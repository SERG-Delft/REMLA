### Configuration Management

Sufficient
: The configuration management of the AI pipeline is explained in a way that can be understood by stakeholders with a common understanding of release engineering and AI engineering concepts. There is a visual overview that helps understand the pipeline. The main decisions are documented and there is a discussion of opportunities or lessons learned.

Good/Very Good
: The configuration management of the AI pipeline is explained in a way that can be understood by stakeholders with a common understanding of release engineering and AI engineering concepts. There is a visual overview that helps understand the pipeline. Other visual diagrams are used to complement text and bring clarity to some of the design choices. All key aspects of the configuration management process are addressed, such as version control, dependency management, code standards, or deployment strategies. There is a clear explanation of the decisions made and a discussion of their impact in the project. There is a discussion of limitations, opportunities and lessons learned.
